                There are nearly <strong>258 million children</strong> world-wide dropped 
                out from the school, 130 million of them girls. Due to 
                <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, schools in 185 countries were forced to
                close their doors to children and caused a global education 
                crisis. According to <strong>UNESCO</strong> and <strong>Save the Children</strong> 
                school closures and lack of access to education present an increased rate of drop-out, 
                where almost <strong>10 million children</strong> may never return to school.

                Our aim with <strong>AIDE</strong> project is to prevent school-dropout at an early stage. 
                The combination of a simple <strong>punch-card system</strong> and artificial intelligence
                /machine learning enables to register student enrolment data, detect and 
                predict school drop outs. In collaboration government and help organizations, 
                <strong>AIDE</strong> can contribute to effective measures to bring children back to school.

        <h1>How does AIDE work?</h1>

        <div class="contentbox">
            <h2>Data collection</h2>
            <p>
                AIDE project assigns a unique number to each student 
                and registers initial data of gender, age, health and 
                travel. In the next step, a simple punch card system 
                keeps regular record of student enrolment.

            <h2>AIDE</h2>
            <p>
                AIDE monitors nation-wide collected information about 
                student enrolment. Artificial intelligence enables AIDE 
                to make precise statistical analyses and suggest specific 
                solutions to REDD BARNA (or other help/education 
                organizations) regarding prevention of student dropout.

            <p>
                AIDE registers measures taken by the help organizations, 
                local authorities and collects data about the output.
