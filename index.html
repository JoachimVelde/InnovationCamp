        <h1>What does AIDE do?</h1>
        <p>
            There are nearly 258 million children world-wide dropped 
            out from the school, 130 million of them girls. Due to 
            COVID-19 pandemic, schools in 185 countries were forced to
            close their doors to children and caused a global education 
            crisis. According to UNESCO and Save the Children school closures
            and lack of access to education present an increased rate of drop-out, 
            where almost 10 million children may never return to school.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our aim with AIDE project is to prevent school-dropout at an early stage. 
            The combination of a simple punch-card system and artificial intelligence
            /machine learning enables to register student enrolment data, detect and 
            predict school drop outs. In collaboration government and help organizations, 
            AIDE can contribute to effective measures to bring children back to school.

            <h2>Data collection</h2>
            <p>
                AIDE project assigns a unique number to each student 
                and registers initial data of gender, age, health and 
                travel. In the next step, a simple punch card system 
                keeps regular record of student enrolment.

                AIDE monitors nation-wide collected information about 
                student enrolment. Artificial intelligence enables AIDE 
                to make precise statistical analyses and suggest specific 
                solutions to REDD BARNA (or other help/education 
                organizations) regarding prevention of student dropout.
